# go-data-structures

As of writing this, today (March 15th, 2022), Go has finally released version 1.18 which comes with the much anticipated (and dare I say controversial?) generic types.

Now I'm not much of a Go enthusiast (Python better + ratio) but I figured this would be a good time to check out what Go has to offer.

Thank you and enjoy.
